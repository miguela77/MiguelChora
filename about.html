        <p> About Miguel!</p>
        <p>Hello, I'm Miguel, a 17-year-old junior at Chicago Math and Science Academy (CMSA) as of the year 2023. My coding journey commenced in the winter of 2022 through participation in my first coding program, "Code Nation." During this transformative experience, I dedicated weekends to intensive workshops, attending twice a month for 8 hours a day. This commitment was not just about learning code; it was a testament to my eagerness to delve into the world of programming.</p>

        <p>I'm passionate about technology and exploring the world of programming.  At Code Nation, I undertook numerous projects and websites, showcasing my skills and creativity where you can find in the "Projects" tab. This collection serves as a visual representation of my growth and proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—the foundational languages that have become my tools for turning ideas into digital reality. </p>

         <p> As my journey unfolds, I find myself now enrolled in another phase of Code Nation—the GrubHub Fellowship I program. This represents a continued commitment to refining and enhancing my coding skills. The fellowship promises to be a platform for deeper exploration and mastery, providing a unique opportunity to engage with coding challenges in a more profound way.</p>

         <p> My aspiration extends beyond just coding proficiency. I aim to leverage my skills to create websites that authentically reflect who I am and my passions. These digital platforms will be more than just code; they will be an extension of my identity, encapsulating my journey and aspirations.</p>

    </p> Looking ahead, I recognize the dynamic nature of web development. I am eager to embrace new technologies, collaborate with like-minded peers, and continually innovate. The coding world is expansive, and I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.</p>

         <p> In conclusion, my coding journey is not just a series of educational milestones; it is a narrative of personal and technical growth. Each paragraph of code, each workshop attended, contributes to the evolving story of who I am becoming as a coder. As I navigate through the GrubHub Fellowship I program, I am excited about the challenges and opportunities that will shape the next chapters of my coding journey. </p>
